# July 2025 ECS Refactor Documentation

This folder contains all the architectural analysis and planning documents created during the July 2025 ECS refactor planning phase.

## Key Documents

### **Primary Guidance Document**
- `COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` - Complete architectural analysis and detailed implementation plan

### **Supporting Analysis Documents**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Original context and problem understanding
- `CORRECT_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system specification
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed gap analysis
- `OOM_ANALYSIS_AND_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` - OOM prevention analysis
- `DUAL_LAYER_ECS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Initial implementation plan

## Implementation Status at Document Creation

- **System Completion**: 70% complete (revised from 85%)
- **Architecture Quality**: Excellent foundation with sophisticated optimizations
- **Critical Issues**: 5 fundamental architectural inconsistencies identified
- **Implementation Approach**: Surgical refactoring of existing system

## Refactor Strategy

**Phase 1**: Types System Refactoring (Week 1-2)
**Phase 2**: Store Architecture Complete Refactor (Week 3-4)
**Phase 3**: UI Hooks and Store Debugging (Week 5)
**Phase 4**: Main Layers Organization (Week 6-7)
**Phase 5**: Implementation and Testing (Week 8-10)

## Success Criteria

- True ECS architecture with O(1) memory usage
- Pixel-perfect shaders with clean mesh data
- Crystal clear data/mirror layer separation
- Consistent visual behavior at all zoom levels
- Modern GPU pipeline with shader-ready vertex buffers
