# Phase 3B: Vertex Authority Architecture Fix

## 🎯 **CORE ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE**

**VERTICES ARE AUTHORITY** - All property values must derive from vertices through a single computation path.

## ❌ **CURRENT PROBLEM: MULTIPATH BULLSHIT**

**Problem**: Multiple ways to populate UI values causing inconsistency:
- Path 1: Direct property access for UI display
- Path 2: Vertex recalculation during updates
- Path 3: Input value propagation

**Result**: Radius gets halved on first edit, but not subsequent edits.

## ✅ **REQUIRED ARCHITECTURE: SINGLE PATH AUTHORITY**

### **Single Data Flow**
```
Vertices (AUTHORITY) → Computed Properties → UI Display
```

### **All Changes Must Go Through Vertices**
```
UI Input Change → Generate New Vertices → Recompute Properties → Update Store → Refresh UI
```

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **1. Vertex Authority Principle**
- Vertices are the single source of truth
- All properties are computed values derived from vertices
- No direct property manipulation

### **2. Single Update Path**
- All editing operations generate new vertices
- Properties are always recomputed from vertices
- UI always displays computed properties (never cached/stored values)

### **3. Consistent Calculation Chain**
```typescript
// CORRECT FLOW:
User edits radius → Generate vertices from radius → Store vertices → Compute properties from vertices → Display computed radius

// WRONG FLOW:
User edits radius → Store radius directly → Display stored radius (MULTIPATH!)
```

## 📋 **SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED**

### **Fix 1: ObjectEditPanel Radius Editing**
- Input change → Generate new circle vertices from center + radius
- Store new vertices (not radius value)
- Properties auto-computed from stored vertices
- UI displays computed radius from properties

### **Fix 2: Eliminate Direct Property Storage**
- Remove any direct property setters
- All property changes go through vertex generation
- Single computation path for all shapes

### **Fix 3: Consistent Property Calculation**
- Fix circle property calculation if it's wrong
- Ensure all shape property calculations are consistent
- Same calculation used for creation and editing

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: NO MULTIPATH**

**RULE**: Only ONE way to populate UI values:
1. Read object from store
2. Access object.properties (computed from vertices)
3. Display in UI

**NO**: 
- Direct input value storage
- Cached property values 
- Multiple calculation paths
- Fallback property sources

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

- ✅ Radius editing shows correct value immediately
- ✅ No halving on first edit
- ✅ Consistent behavior on all edits
- ✅ Single computation path for all properties
- ✅ Vertices remain authoritative source

## 📝 **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

This fix ensures that the vertex authority principle is maintained throughout the system, eliminating the multipath issues that cause inconsistent behavior.
