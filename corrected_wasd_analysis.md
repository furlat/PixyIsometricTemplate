# 🎯 **CORRECTED WASD ANALYSIS - LAYER-SPECIFIC MOVEMENT**

## 🔍 **THE USER IS RIGHT - MY CAMERA APPROACH WAS WRONG**

### **Issue with Camera Transform Approach**:
If I move the entire `cameraTransform`, it moves:
- ✅ Geometry objects (what we want)
- ❌ Background mesh/grid (should stay stationary)
- ❌ Mouse highlights, selection, everything (breaks coordinate alignment)

## 🏗️ **LAYERED INFINITE CANVAS STRUCTURE**

```
cameraTransform (main container)
├── backgroundLayer (mesh/grid - should stay stationary)
├── geometryLayer (objects - should move with WASD) 
├── selectionLayer (should move with objects)
├── mouseLayer (should stay aligned with mesh)
└── other layers...
```

## ✅ **CORRECT SOLUTION: GEOMETRY LAYER OFFSET**

### **Location**: `LayeredInfiniteCanvas.renderGeometryLayer()`
### **Approach**: Apply offset transform only to geometry layer

```typescript
private renderGeometryLayer(corners: ViewportCorners, pixeloidScale: number): void {
  if (gameStore.geometry.layerVisibility.geometry) {
    this.geometryRenderer.render(corners, pixeloidScale)
    
    // Clear and re-add renderer container
    this.geometryLayer.removeChildren()
    this.geometryLayer.addChild(this.geometryRenderer.getContainer())
    
    // ✅ NEW: Apply offset transform to geometry layer only
    const currentOffset = gameStore.mesh.vertex_to_pixeloid_offset
    this.geometryLayer.position.set(-currentOffset.x, -currentOffset.y)
    
    // Texture capture logic...
  }
}
```

### **Why This Works**:
1. **Background mesh stays stationary** (aligned with vertex coordinates)
2. **Geometry objects move** with offset (showing movement through world)
3. **Mouse coordinates stay aligned** with mesh
4. **Selection highlights move** with geometry (correct behavior)

## 🎯 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **WASD Movement**:
- User presses W → offset changes → geometryLayer moves up → objects appear to move up relative to grid ✅
- Grid/mesh stays perfectly aligned with mouse coordinates ✅
- Objects move smoothly as layer transform is updated ✅

### **Coordinate Consistency**:
- Mesh vertex (0,0) always at screen position based on camera ✅  
- Geometry at pixeloid (0,0) appears at mesh position (0,0) - offset ✅
- Mouse clicking on mesh vertex gets correct pixeloid coordinate ✅

**This is the correct approach - apply offset only to the geometry layer, not the entire camera.**
