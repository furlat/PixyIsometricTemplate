# Pixelate Filter Test Results

## Implementation Complete

### What We've Done
1. **MirrorLayerRenderer** - Added methods to expose texture cache:
   - `getTextureCache()` - Returns cached textures
   - `getSpritePositions()` - Returns sprite positions
   - `getCachedTexture()` - Get specific texture
   - `hasTextureCache()` - Check if texture exists

2. **PixelateFilterRenderer** - Full implementation:
   - Uses PixelateFilter from pixi-filters
   - Sets pixel size = pixeloid scale
   - Creates sprites from cached textures
   - Updates pixel size on zoom

3. **LayeredInfiniteCanvas** - Updated integration:
   - Passes mirror renderer to pixelate renderer
   - Enables proper data flow

4. **LayerToggleBar** - Reconnected UI:
   - Pixelate toggle button now functional
   - Updates store when toggled
   - Dispatches events

## Testing Steps

1. **Enable Mirror Layer First**
   - Click the Mirror button (gray/neutral color)
   - Should see texture copies of geometry

2. **Enable Pixelate Filter**
   - Click the Pixelate button (info/cyan color)
   - Should see pixelated versions of the geometry

3. **Test Zoom**
   - Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
   - Pixel size should match pixeloid scale
   - At scale 10: 10x10 pixel blocks
   - At scale 20: 20x20 pixel blocks

4. **Test Object Creation**
   - Draw new shapes
   - They should appear pixelated when filter is on

## Expected Behavior

✅ Pixelate filter applies to mirror layer sprites
✅ Pixel size exactly matches pixeloid scale
✅ Pixels align perfectly with pixeloid grid
✅ Filter updates dynamically on zoom
✅ Toggle on/off works instantly

## Performance Notes

- Container-level filtering (single filter instance)
- Reuses cached textures from MirrorLayerRenderer
- No sprite copying, creates new sprites from cache
- Efficient memory usage

## Next Steps

1. Test with multiple objects
2. Verify alignment at different scales
3. Check performance with 20+ objects
4. Consider adding more filters (blur, glow, etc.)
