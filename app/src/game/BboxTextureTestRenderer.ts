/**
 * DECLARATIVE OBJECTIVE:
 * Extract texture of the geometric layer as sprites using pixeloid-perfect bounding boxes 
 * as boundaries to mirror 100% what is happening in the graphics layer.
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Enable capability to apply filters to specific areas of geometry independently 
 * of any other layer and without modifying the geometry layer directly, such that 
 * multiple filters can work in parallel and only later combine results.
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Perfect texture extraction using pixeloid-perfect bounding boxes
 * - 100% visual fidelity with original geometry  
 * - Independent processing pipeline that doesn't modify original geometry
 * - Parallel filter capability for multiple simultaneous operations
 * - Combinable results from multiple filter operations
